# LaTeX-Cover-Letter
My cover letter format in LaTeX, you will need both the .cls and .tex files to compile the cover letter as a pdf. I use TeXShop for all my LaTeX needs if you're needing a free editor/previewer. I want to contribute to open-source software, so know you are welcome to use the format for your own personal use.

Thanks for checking out this project, I appreciate you.

Best of luck,

Alexander Baker.
